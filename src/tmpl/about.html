<h2>{% trans "Why Created This?" %}</h2>
{% blocktrans %}
<p>The creator is a fan of <a href="http://postsecret.blogspot.com/">PostSecret</a>, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/56474392@N00/">30 SECRETS IN 30 DAYS</a>, and <a href="http://www.secrettalk.com/">Secret Talk</a>, however he have never submitted any contents to them. But he does have own secrets wanting to post and he prefers to post on own space, therefore he created LSO. One of other reasons of creation is to allow people posting in their own languages. He has also been reading the secrets on Secret Talk and he found out some commenters are rude and without compassions. He wishes LSO could become a better place. <a href="http://letsecretsout.blogspot.com/2009/11/how-this-gets-started.html">Read more...</a></p>
